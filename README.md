# AIML-Random-Forest-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Task9
Built an end-to-end fraud detection system using machine learning to identify suspicious transactions in an imbalanced dataset. Performed preprocessing, stratified splitting, and baseline Logistic Regression, then improved performance with Random Forest. Evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score, saved the model for deployment use.
